# Fibonacci-Assignment

## Problem Statement
Create a class with a annotated method fibonacci that takes an integer n as a parameter and returns the nth Fibonacci number.

Annotate the fibonacci method with the @tailrec annotation to indicate that the method uses tail recursion.

Call the fibonacci method inside the Main Object, passing in a positive integer n.

Print the result returned by the fibonacci method.

Input: 10
Output: 55

### There are three files in this project

1. FindFibonacci.scala = It contains a tailrecursive method to find the nth fibonacci number.
2. FindFibonacciDriver.scala = It is used to print and check the output on the console.
3. FibonacciSpec.scala = This is the test file which contains the test cases for the tailrecursive method.
